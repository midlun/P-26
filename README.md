3½ tsp chilli sauce

For the rajma topping

For the uncooked salsa
Combine all the ingredients in a deep bowl, mix well and mash it lightly using the back of a spoon for 2 to 3 minutes so that the flavours blend well. Keep aside. 

How to proceed
1. Fill a taco shell with 1 tbsp of rajma topping, ½ tbsp of uncooked salsa and spread ½ tsp of tomato ketchup and ¼ tsp of chilli sauce evenly over it. 
2. Arrange a few shredded lettuce leaves and 2 tsp of grated cheese evenly over it. 
3. Repeat steps 1 and 2 to make 13 more tacos. 
Serve immediately. 

Handy tip: ¾ cup of raw rajma when soaked for 8 hours, drained and pressure cooked with enough water for 6 whistles gives 2 cups of cooked rajma.
